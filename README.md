## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS animations (for background gradient effect)


### What I learned

Different kinds of **hover effects**

### Continued development

Even though this challenge didn't instruct me to create a Moving linear gradient and keyframes,
I'm here to implement stuff that I learned from different resources, to help me become more familiar on coding. And tackling this challenge 
gives me a good experience on how to implement ideas in my future projects. And to share ideas, hopefully people can learn and get some ideas from it too.
